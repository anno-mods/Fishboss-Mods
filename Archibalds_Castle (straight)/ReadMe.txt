Archibalds Castle v1.4.1:

This Mod adds 11 modular buildable parts of a castle into the game (1 greater main building 2 main-buildings and 8 side-buildings), unlocked at 750 investors. The castle mainly consists of buildings from Archibald Blake (3rd Party) and some parts of other buldings.


Installation: 1. Extract the zip-file into your mod folder of your Anno 1800 installationdir (standard = C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games\Anno 1800\mods).
	      2. Go to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games\Anno 1800\mods\Archibalds_Castle\data\config\export\main\asset (standard) and choose between "assets_straight" OR "assets_smooth" and rename it to "assets"
              3. Delete or cut out the other asset, because otherwise there could be crashes   

                 Explanation: You got the choice! Do you want a straight castle but with an offset between the individual modules (choose "assets_straight" and rename it to "assets") 
                              OR a crooked castle but with smooth connections between the modules (choose "assets_smooth" and rename it to "assets")

!!!You need the latest version of modloader (0.7.3)!!!


After you installed the mod, you can find the castle at the building-menu of investors (castle icon).

Just push Shift + v for choosing between the individual main-buildings (left icon) or side-buildings (right icon).
