Historic_harbour v1.0.1:

This mod adds 3 new buildings: a new harbor master's office and 2 new warehouses. The appearance of the new building is based on the warehouse district of Hamburg

The new harbor master's office offers a total of 5 slots (push home/end button) and a 50% larger radius

The two warehouses have 30 tons more capacity than a normal warehouse

In return for their advantages, the new buildings are more expensive to maintain and more expensive to build

The new buildings will be unlocked at 3000 engineers
