Townhall-monument 1.0.2

This mod adds a special townhall, which you can build up in 3 stages. To compesate it's size it has some advantages compared to a normal townhall. 
It does have a much wider radius and 6 slots for items/specialists (scroll up/down). The model is based on the Hamburg City Hall (not 100 % faithful).
You need 7500 investors to unlock this building.

Installation: 1. If necessary, delete the old Townhall-monument folder in your mods-folder of your Anno directory (standard = C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games\Anno 1800\mods)
	       
              2. Extract the zip into your mods folder of your Anno 1800 directory.


!!!You need the latest version of modloader (0.7.3)!!!


!!!This mod is compatible with already existing savegames. No Unlocker is needed!!!


After you installed the mod, you can find the townhall-monument in the investors-building-menu.
